# System Design for QA

System design is not just for architects. QA needs to understand **how the system works** to test it well.

## Key components to recognize

- Clients (web, mobile, APIs)
- Load balancers and gateways
- Services and microservices
- Datastores (SQL, NoSQL, caches)
- Messaging and event buses

## What QA should ask

- Where are the single points of failure?
- How does the system scale under load?
- What happens when dependencies fail?
- How is observability implemented (logs, metrics, traces)?

## Outputs

- Test strategy mapped to system components.
- Risk-based test coverage for critical paths.
