# Performance & Reliability

## Performance testing focus

- Response times under expected and peak load
- Throughput and resource utilization
- Degradation patterns, not just pass/fail

## Reliability testing focus

- Failure modes (timeouts, partial outages, dependency failures)
- Recovery behavior and self-healing
- Data consistency after failures

## Practical ideas

- Start with a small, realistic workload profile.
- Combine performance tests with strong observability.
- Use chaos-style experiments in non-production to validate resilience.
