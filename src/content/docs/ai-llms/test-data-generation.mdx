# AI Test Data Generation

## Why AI for test data

- Quickly brainstorm diverse inputs.
- Cover edge cases you might miss manually.

## Good patterns

- Ask for **valid**, **invalid**, and **boundary** values.
- Describe the domain clearly (e.g., fintech, healthcare).
- Request outputs in a structured format (tables, JSON).

## Example prompt

> Generate 20 realistic test customer records with edge cases for an e-commerce system.  
> Include: name, email, address, country, and account status.
