# Prompting for QA

## Principles

- Be **specific** about context, constraints, and output format.
- Use **examples** to teach the model what you want.
- Iterate on prompts based on results.

## Common QA prompt patterns

- \"Generate test cases for this requirement...\"\n- \"Summarize this bug in three bullet points...\"\n- \"Propose edge cases for this API schema...\"\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [ ] Clear role and goal in the prompt.\n- [ ] Input data is anonymized or synthetic.\n- [ ] Output format is specified (bullets, JSON, table, etc.).\n
