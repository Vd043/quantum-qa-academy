# AI for Testers

AI is a **power tool**, not a replacement for testers.

## Core use cases

- Generating test ideas and scenarios
- Summarizing requirements and bug reports
- Assisting with log and trace analysis
- Drafting test data and fixtures

## Guardrails

- Never paste sensitive data into external tools.
- Always review AI output critically.
- Treat AI suggestions as **drafts**, not truth.
