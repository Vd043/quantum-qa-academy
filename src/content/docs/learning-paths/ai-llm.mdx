# AI & LLM Path

**Who this is for:**  
QA and automation engineers curious about using AI in a practical, safe way.

**Prerequisites:**  
Basic familiarity with prompts and chat-based tools.

## Phase 1 – Foundations: AI for Testers

- Read: [AI for Testers](/ai-llms/ai-for-testers)
- Exercise: Use an LLM to generate test ideas for a simple feature and then filter them.

## Phase 2 – Prompting for QA Workflows

- Read: [Prompting for QA](/ai-llms/prompting)
- Exercise: Design prompts for:
  - Test case generation
  - Bug report summarization
  - Log analysis

## Phase 3 – AI-Driven Test Data & Automation Support

- Read: [AI Test Data Generation](/ai-llms/test-data-generation)
- Exercise: Use an LLM to propose realistic, edge-case-heavy test data sets.

## Done when

You can:

- Integrate AI into your daily QA workflows while protecting quality and security.
- Design prompts that give you reliable, structured outputs.
