# System Design Path

**Who this is for:**  
QA and automation engineers who interact with architects, SREs, and senior developers.

**Prerequisites:**  
Comfortable with basic web app concepts, HTTP, and databases.

## Phase 1 – System Design from a QA Lens

- Read: [System Design for QA](/system-design/qa-perspective)
- Exercise: Draw a simple diagram for a three-tier web app and mark key test points.

## Phase 2 – Performance, Reliability, and Observability

- Read: [Performance & Reliability](/system-design/perf-reliability)
- Exercise: Identify performance and reliability risks in your current or a sample project.

## Phase 3 – Test Strategies for Distributed Systems

- Combine: [QA SDLC Overview](/qa-sdlc/overview) and [System Design for QA](/system-design/qa-perspective).
- Design: A test strategy for a microservices-based system (happy paths, failure modes, chaos).

## Done when

You can:

- Read a system design diagram and ask sharp QA questions.
- Propose tests for scalability, resilience, and observability.
