**Who this is for:**  
Testers with QA basics who want to ship reliable automation for UI and APIs.

**Prerequisites:**

- Basic programming knowledge (Java preferred, or another OOP language).

## Phase 1 – Automation Foundations

- Read: [Automation Foundations](/automation/foundations)
- Read: [QA SDLC Overview](/qa-sdlc/overview)

**Outcome:** You understand when automation is valuable and how it fits into the SDLC.

## Phase 2 – UI Automation with Selenium + Java

## Phase 3 – API Testing

- Read: [API Testing](/automation/api-testing)
- Exercise:
  - Automate three to five API tests for a public API.
  - Validate status codes, payloads, and edge cases.

## Phase 4 – CI/CD Integration

- Read: [CI/CD for QA](/automation/ci-cd)
- Exercise:
  - Run your tests on each commit using a CI tool (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI).

## Done when

You can:

- Decide what to automate and what not to.
- Build and maintain Selenium and API tests in a clean structure.
- Run tests reliably in CI and troubleshoot failures.
