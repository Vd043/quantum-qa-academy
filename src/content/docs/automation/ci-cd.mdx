# CI/CD for QA

## Objectives

- Integrate automated tests into a CI pipeline.
- Provide fast, actionable feedback on each change.

## Where tests fit in the pipeline

- Unit tests → on every commit.
- API and UI smoke tests → on main branch and before releases.
- Full regression → nightly or on-demand.

## Common platforms

- GitHub Actions
- Jenkins
- GitLab CI

## Best practices

- Keep pipelines **fast** and **reliable**.
- Fail fast and surface root cause clearly.
- Separate smoke vs. full regression suites.
