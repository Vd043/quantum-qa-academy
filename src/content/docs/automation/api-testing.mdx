# API Testing

## Why API tests matter

API tests are fast, reliable, and close to the business logic. They are ideal for regression.

## Types of API tests

- Happy path and basic CRUD
- Negative tests and validation
- Contract tests (schema, types, enums)
- Integration flows across services

## Typical toolchain

- Postman / Newman
- REST Assured (Java)
- HTTP client + assertion library in your preferred language

## Practical checklist

- [ ] Status codes validated (2xx, 4xx, 5xx cases)
- [ ] Response schema validated
- [ ] Edge cases and error handling covered
- [ ] Authentication and authorization tested
