# Automation Foundations

Automation is a **strategy**, not just a collection of scripts.

## What to automate

- High-value regression flows
- Stable, repeatable scenarios
- Data-intensive checks
- API contracts and integrations

## What not to automate (early)

- Volatile UI still changing daily
- Exploratory and UX feel
- One-off, low-frequency migrations

## Principles

- Keep tests **deterministic** and **fast**.
- Prefer **API** over UI when possible.
- Treat test code as a **production asset** (reviews, refactoring, standards).
