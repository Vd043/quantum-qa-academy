# Test Execution & Reporting

## Objectives

- Run tests in a controlled, repeatable way.
- Communicate status and risk, not just pass/fail counts.

## Execution best practices

- Prioritize tests by risk and business impact.
- Keep execution logs clear and timestamped.
- Isolate environment and data issues from product defects.

## Reporting essentials

- Current status (what’s passed, failed, blocked).
- Key risks discovered.
- Trends vs. previous runs (e.g., regression failures).

## Practical checklist

- [ ] Daily or per-run status shared with stakeholders.
- [ ] Top risks are highlighted, not buried.
- [ ] Failures are linked to clear defect reports.
