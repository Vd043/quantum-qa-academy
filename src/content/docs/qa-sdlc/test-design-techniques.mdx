# Test Design Techniques

## Why techniques matter

Good test design finds important bugs **early** with **fewer** cases.

## Core techniques

- **Equivalence Partitioning (EP)** – group inputs into valid/invalid classes.
- **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)** – focus on edges where bugs cluster.
- **Decision Tables** – capture complex business rules.
- **State Transition Testing** – model systems that change state.

## Example: boundary values

For an input range `1–10`:

- Valid: 1, 10
- Just outside: 0, 11

## Practical checklist

- [ ] At least one technique is applied per feature.
- [ ] Boundaries are explicitly tested.
- [ ] Business rules are captured in a decision table where applicable.
