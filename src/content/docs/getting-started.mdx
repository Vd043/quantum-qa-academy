# How to Use This Site

QuantumQA Academy is designed as a **hub for long, focused learning sessions**.

## 1. Start with a path

Pick one path that fits your current stage:

- **Beginner QA Path** – if you are new to QA or coming from dev/support.
- **Automation Engineer Path** – if you already understand QA basics and want deep automation.
- **System Design Path** – if you want to participate confidently in design discussions.
- **AI & LLM Path** – if you want to leverage AI in your daily QA work.

Follow the modules in order. Each module has:

- Learning objectives
- Recommended reading
- Hands-on exercises
- A “Done when” checklist

## 2. Use topics as references

The topic sections (QA SDLC, Automation, etc.) act as:

- **Reference docs** when you’re stuck at work
- **Drill-down material** linked from the learning paths

## 3. Revisit roadmaps and cheat sheets

- Use **roadmaps** to see what’s next.
- Use **cheat sheets** to quickly recall commands, patterns, and templates.

## 4. Stay current

QuantumQA Academy is designed to be **agent-updated weekly**:

- New topics and patterns added automatically.
- You can track changes via the Weekly updates section (from the repo’s PR history).
